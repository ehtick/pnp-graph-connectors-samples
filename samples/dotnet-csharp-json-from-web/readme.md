# dotnet-csharp-json-from-web

## Summary

I kept having to link my colleagues blog posts I've made over time, so I figured I would find a way to integrate them into my search results. This sample shows how to use a custom connector to index a JSON file from a website. The JSON file contains a list of blog posts, and the connector indexes the title, content, and URL of each blog post.

## Features

Extended description of the contents of the sample. What elements does it include? What concepts does illustrate? What type of content is it processing?

Using this sample you can use the Copilot connector to:

* Ingest data from a JSON file
* Making it searchable in Microsoft Search
* Making it available in Copilot
* Using the `ItemIdResolver` to make sure Microsoft Search can resolve the item ID to a URL and therefor know when it's being linked in other parts of Microsoft 365.
