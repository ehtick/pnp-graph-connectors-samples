# Title of the sample

<!--
This is how you want the sample to appear in the samples browser.
When naming your sample, try to give it a friendly name that describes what it does. Avoid using terms like `Copilot connector` and `sample` -- because that's what all the samples in this repo are all about.

GOOD 👍:
  Ingesting markdown content to Microsoft 365
BAD 👎:
  graph-connector-import
  Sample code that shows how to build a Copilot connector that ingests content from markdown files to Microsoft 365
-->

## Summary

Short summary on the contents of the sample. What type of content is it ingesting? Using what language and on which platform is it built? Does it contain the adaptive card to show the content in search? Is it packaged as a Teams app for easy deployment?

<!--
Please provide a high-quality screenshot of the sample in action. Include a screenshot of the content that the sample is ingesting. Ideally, also include an image of how the ingested content is displayed in search results.

Upload the image in a subfolder named `assets`. Use a resolution of 1920x1080.

You can add multiple screenshots to help users understand your samples without having to download  and install it.

PRO TIP:

For commands, use the `code syntax`. For button labels, page names, dialog names, etc. as they appear on the screen, use **Bold**. Don't use "click", use "select" or "use".

As tempting as it may be, don't just use images to describe the steps. Let's be as inclusive as possible and think about accessibility.

We have basic documentation about Copilot connectors and how to build them that you can reference on top of any additional steps that your sample needs:

* [Copilot connectors overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-connectors-overview)
* [Build your first custom Copilot connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-build-quickstart)

-->

* Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/copilot-connectors-samples/tree/main/samples/YOUR-SOLUTION-NAME) then unzip it)
* ...provide further instructions
